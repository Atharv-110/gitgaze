# Contribution RulesðŸ“š:

- You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
- Do NOT add any build steps, e.g., npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
- Do NOT remove other content.
- Styling/code can be pretty, ugly, or stupid, big or small, as long as it works
<!-- - Add your name to the contributorsList file. -->
- Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts

## Getting Started ðŸ¤©ðŸ¤—:

- Clone it on your local machine

```markdown
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/gitgaze.git

<!--- - Add your name to `contributors/contributorsList.js`. -->

## Avoid Conflicts {Syncing your fork}

An easy way to avoid conflicts is to add an 'upstream' for your git repo, as other PRs may be merged while you're working on your branch/fork.   

```markdown
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<your-username>/gitgaze.git
```

You can verify that the new remote has been added by typing:

```markdown
git remote -v
```

To pull any new changes from your parent repo, simply run:

```markdown
git merge upstream/main
```

This will give you any eventual conflicts and allow you to easily solve them in your repo. It's a good idea to use it frequently in between your own commits to make sure that your repo is up to date with its parent.
